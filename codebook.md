###Data tidy:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4.Create the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###Column list
The result of dataset has 82 columns: 

[1] "subject_id" : The subject ID, an integer in the range 1:30                    
 [2] "activity_id": The activity id performed by the subject                    
 [3] "activity_name" : The activity description of the relative activity id
